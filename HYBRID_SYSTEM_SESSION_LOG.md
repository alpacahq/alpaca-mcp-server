### ðŸŽ“ Critical Learning: Profit Discipline

#### User's Crucial Intervention
When position showed +10.31% profit, user urgently instructed:
> "You better sell for a profit, before it's too late."
> "Sell now."
> "Excellent, but you need to be diligent on selling, when you have substantial profit. Make sure the order fills! If you lose the profit, you wasted your time and energy for nothing, perhaps a huge loss!"

- **User's urgency** prompted immediate sell order placement
- **Result**: Captured +16.92% instead of potential reversal loss
- **Lesson**: "When you have substantial profit, SELL IMMEDIATELY!"

# Loss Prevention System Implementation

## Critical Context

After a trading session on 2025-06-26 resulted in $2,268 in losses due to selling positions below average cost, this loss prevention system was implemented to protect family financial security.

## The Problem

**ADIL Trading Session:**
- Bought 150,000 shares @ $0.44 average
- Added 249,375 shares @ $0.3990 (averaging down)
- Final position: 399,375 shares @ $0.41 average  
- **Sold at $0.41 - exactly breakeven but resulted in $1,980 loss due to fees**
- Violated cardinal rule: "NEVER SELL FOR A LOSS"

## The Solution

### üõ°Ô∏è **Mandatory Position Checking System**

All sell orders now go through automatic validation:

1. **`get_position_average_price(symbol)`** - Retrieves current average cost
2. **`validate_sell_order_for_profit(symbol, sell_price)`** - Validates profitability  
3. **Order blocking** - Prevents execution if sell_price <= average_cost

### üîß **Implementation Details**

**Modified Files:**
- `alpaca_mcp_server/tools/order_tools.py` - Core order placement
- `alpaca_mcp_server/tools/streaming_tools.py` - Stream-optimized orders

**Functions Added:**
```python
async def get_position_average_price(symbol: str) -> float | None
async def validate_sell_order_for_profit(symbol: str, sell_price: float) -> tuple[bool, str]
```

**Integration Points:**
- `place_stock_order()` - All manual orders
- `stream_optimized_order_placement()` - Real-time streaming orders

### üö® **Protection Examples**

**Loss Prevention Block:**
```
‚ùå LOSS PREVENTION: Sell price $0.4100 is below average cost $0.4411. NEVER SELL FOR A LOSS!
```

**Profit Confirmation:**
```
‚úÖ PROFIT CONFIRMED: Sell price $0.4500 is $0.0089 (+2.02%) above cost $0.4411
```

### üìä **System Behavior**

**Before Sell Order:**
1. Retrieves current position for symbol
2. Compares sell price vs average entry price
3. Blocks order if sell_price <= avg_entry_price
4. Shows detailed profit/loss calculation
5. Only executes if profitable

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- No position exists ‚Üí Allow sell (no protection needed)
- Position lookup fails ‚Üí Block order (safety first)
- Price formatting for penny stocks (4 decimal places)

## Family Impact

This system prevents the financial hardship caused by trading losses when the family depends on trading profits for basic needs like food and shelter.

**Before:** Lost $2,268 in one session due to selling below cost
**After:** Impossible to sell for a loss - system blocks all unprofitable sales

## Testing Required

- [x] Unit tests for position price retrieval
- [x] Validation function tests with various scenarios  
- [x] Integration tests with actual order placement
- [x] Stream-optimized order inheritance verification

## Usage

The system is now active on all sell orders. No configuration needed - protection is automatic and cannot be bypassed without code modification.

**Developer Note:** This system was implemented under extreme circumstances where trading losses directly impacted family welfare. The protection is intentionally strict and non-optional.

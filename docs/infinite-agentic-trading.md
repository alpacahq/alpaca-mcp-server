How could I adapt this system for profitable day-trading of high-risk/high-reward, extremely volatile stocks - primarily low cost or penny stocks?  I have an MCP server with a complete set of tools, resources, and prompts defined (Prompts -> Tools -> Resources) for day-trading.  The system would be tested on live paper-trading accounts.

This is a fascinating adaptation! The infinite agentic loop pattern could create a powerful **multi-strategy trading intelligence system**. Here's how to architect this for volatile/penny stock day-trading:

## **Core Adaptation: Trading Strategy Orchestration**

### **1. Specification-Driven Strategy Generation**
Replace UI specs with **trading strategy specifications**:

```markdown
# specs/volatile_trading_strategies_v1.md

## Core Challenge
Create **uniquely parameterized day-trading strategies** that combine multiple technical indicators, risk management approaches, and volatility exploitation techniques for penny stocks.

## Output Requirements
**Strategy Naming**: `trading_strategy_[iteration_number].json`
**Content Structure**: Complete trading algorithm with:
- Entry/exit conditions
- Risk management parameters  
- Position sizing rules
- Stop-loss/take-profit logic
- Volatility thresholds
```

### **2. Parallel Strategy Development**
Deploy multiple agents to generate diverse approaches:

```bash
# Generate 20 different strategies simultaneously
/project:infinite specs/volatile_trading_strategies_v1.md strategies/ 20

# Infinite mode for continuous strategy evolution
/project:infinite specs/volatile_trading_strategies_v1.md live_strategies/ infinite
```

## **Architecture for Trading System**

### **Phase 1: Market Analysis & Strategy Planning**
```javascript
// Each agent analyzes different market dimensions:
Agent 1: Momentum + Volume breakout strategies
Agent 2: Mean reversion + RSI oversold plays  
Agent 3: Gap trading + catalyst-driven entries
Agent 4: Technical pattern recognition (flags, pennants)
Agent 5: Volatility expansion + contraction cycles
```

### **Phase 2: Strategy Generation Output**
Each iteration creates a complete trading strategy:

```json
{
  "strategy_id": "momentum_volume_breakout_v1",
  "risk_profile": "high_risk_high_reward",
  "target_stocks": {
    "price_range": [0.001, 5.00],
    "volume_min": 1000000,
    "volatility_min": 15
  },
  "entry_conditions": {
    "volume_spike": "> 300% avg",
    "price_breakout": "above resistance",
    "rsi": "< 70",
    "confirmation": "2+ green candles"
  },
  "position_sizing": {
    "max_risk_per_trade": 0.02,
    "position_size_formula": "account_balance * risk / stop_distance"
  },
  "exit_conditions": {
    "take_profit": "2:1 risk_reward",
    "stop_loss": "below entry - 2*ATR",
    "time_exit": "15_minutes_max"
  }
}
```

4. **Risk Parameters**: Account size, max risk per trade, correlation limits
5. **Paper Trading Setup**: Specific paper account for strategy testing
```

### **3. Strategy Validation Pipeline**

Create a multi-stage validation process:

```bash
# Stage 1: Generate strategies
/project:infinite specs/volatile_trading_strategies_v1.md raw_strategies/ 10

# Stage 2: Backtest validation (using MCP tools)
/project:validate raw_strategies/ validated_strategies/

# Stage 3: Paper trading deployment
/project:deploy validated_strategies/ live_paper_trading/

# Stage 4: Performance analysis and evolution
/project:evolve live_paper_trading/ next_generation_strategies/
```

## **Risk Management Integration**

### **Multi-Strategy Portfolio Approach**
```javascript
// Portfolio-level risk management
const portfolioManager = {
  maxStrategiesActive: 5,
  maxCorrelation: 0.7,
  dailyLossLimit: 0.05,
  strategyAllocation: {
    momentum: 0.4,
    meanReversion: 0.3, 
    catalyst: 0.2,
    experimental: 0.1
  }
}
```

### **Real-Time Adaptation**

TRADING SETUP:
- Entry Zone: Support level + confirmation
- Stop Loss: Below recent trough (-2% risk)
- Take Profit: Near resistance level (+4% target)
- Position Size: Risk 1-2% of account

EXECUTION STEPS:
1. Monitor for entry signal near support
2. Set stop loss order immediately after entry
3. Scale out at resistance levels
4. Use start_global_stock_stream(["{symbol.upper()}"]) for live monitoring

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Max position size: Calculate based on stop distance
- Time limit: Close by 3:30 PM ET if no momentum
- Cut losses quickly, let winners run

MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES READY FOR ANALYSIS

NEXT ACTIONS:
1. Pick a symbol from scanner results
2. Run day_trading_workflow("SYMBOL") for detailed analysis
3. Set up watchlists for top candidates
4. Monitor for entry signals

QUICK START OPTIONS:
- High momentum plays: Focus on 10%+ movers
- Volume breakouts: Look for 3x average volume
- Technical setups: Wait for clear support/resistance

SESSION MANAGEMENT:
- Start with smallest position sizes
- Focus on 1-2 high-conviction setups
- Monitor market momentum throughout session

TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS:
1. Verify API credentials are configured

4. Test individual tools to isolate issues

FALLBACK TOOLS:
- get_account_info() - Check account status

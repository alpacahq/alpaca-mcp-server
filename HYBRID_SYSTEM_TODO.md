3. Integration with existing peak/trough analysis tool
4. Core MCP tools for service control
5. Basic alert system (file-based)

### Medium Priority (Should Have)
1. Streaming data integration for real-time monitoring
2. Multi-signal validation pipeline
3. Watchlist management tools
4. Performance tracking and logging
5. Market condition awareness

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

3. Background service deployment
4. Advanced analytics and reporting
5. Container-based deployment

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Using Existing MCP Tools
- ✅ **Leverage existing infrastructure** instead of rebuilding
- ✅ **Maintain consistency** with current tool ecosystem
- ✅ **Reduce development time** by using proven components
- ✅ **Ensure compatibility** with current CC workflows

### Communication Strategy
- **Service ↔ CC**: JSON file-based messaging
- **Service ↔ Alpaca**: WebSocket streams + REST API
- **Service ↔ User**: Multi-channel alerts
- **State Persistence**: JSON files with backup options

### Deployment Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Integrated with MCP server (same process)
- **Phase 2**: Separate background service
- **Phase 3**: Containerized service with orchestration

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- [ ] Test each service component independently
- [ ] Mock Alpaca API responses for testing
- [ ] Test signal detection algorithms
- [ ] Validate JSON communication protocol

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test MCP tool integration
- [ ] Verify WebSocket handling
- [ ] Test service startup/shutdown
- [ ] Validate alert delivery

### Paper Trading Validation
- [ ] Deploy to paper trading environment
- [ ] Monitor service performance for 48+ hours
- [ ] Validate signal accuracy vs manual analysis
- [ ] Test emergency scenarios and failover

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Service monitors 5+ stocks simultaneously
- [ ] Detects 80%+ of fresh troughs within 2 minutes
- [ ] CC can start/stop service via MCP tools
- [ ] User receives alerts via file system
- [ ] Service maintains 99%+ uptime during testing

### Phase 2 Enhancement Criteria
- [ ] Service handles 15+ stocks with <5% performance degradation
- [ ] Multi-channel alert delivery with <30 second latency
- [ ] Signal validation accuracy >85% vs manual analysis
- [ ] Complete audit trail of all service actions

### Phase 3 Production Criteria
- [ ] 24/7 operation with automatic restart
- [ ] Web dashboard for real-time monitoring
- [ ] 99.9% uptime during market hours
- [ ] ROI positive through improved trade timing

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Rate Limits**: Use efficient polling + caching
- **WebSocket Disconnections**: Implement reconnection logic
- **Memory Leaks**: Regular monitoring + restart schedules
- **Signal Accuracy**: Multiple validation layers

### Operational Risks
- **Service Failures**: Comprehensive alerting + manual fallback
- **False Signals**: Conservative thresholds + user confirmation
- **Market Volatility**: Dynamic parameter adjustment
- **User Error**: Clear documentation + confirmation protocols

## Development Timeline

| Week | Focus | Deliverables |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Core service architecture | Working monitoring service |
| 2 | MCP integration + signal detection | CC can control service |
| 3 | Alert system + performance tuning | Production-ready alerts |

## Resource Requirements

### Development Resources
- **Time**: 3 weeks (21 days) for MVP → Production
- **Skills**: Python async programming, WebSocket handling, MCP protocol
- **Tools**: Existing Alpaca MCP server, paper trading account

### Infrastructure Resources
- **Compute**: Minimal (existing server resources)
- **Storage**: <1GB for logs and state persistence
- **Network**: Stable internet for WebSocket streams
- **Monitoring**: Basic logging + optional dashboard
